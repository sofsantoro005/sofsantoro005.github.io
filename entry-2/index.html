  <title>Doors in NYC</title>

<h1>Looking at the Smaller Picture</h1>

<h2>Form and Design</h2>
<p>
New York City's doors showcase a stunning variety of styles, from ornate brownstone entries to sleek modern glass panels. Look for unique elements like arched frames, decorative ironwork, transom windows, or vibrant paint colors. Pay attention to symmetry, patterns, and how the door fits into the building’s overall aesthetic. The small design choices often reflect the character and era of the neighborhood.
</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>
The materials used in NYC doors vary widely—classic wood with rich textures, sturdy steel for security, or contemporary glass that invites light. Observe how materials weather over time: peeling paint, rust, patina, or polish can add depth to your photos. Try to capture the tactile quality—do the doors look smooth, rough, heavy, or delicate?
</p>

<h2>Size and Scale</h2>
<p>
Doors change drastically depending on their architectural context. In skyscrapers and modern developments, massive revolving or double glass doors create a sense of grandeur and openness. In contrast, townhouses and pre-war buildings often feature more intimate, human-scale entrances. Highlight this contrast in your photography by including elements like door handles, steps, or people to show scale. Try wide shots to show the door in relation to the building, and close-ups to reveal detail.
